    <h2>A brief summary of Bhagat Singh's life</h2>
    <div class="con2">
      <div class="heading">Childhood & Early Life</div>
      <p class="content">
        Bhagat Singh was born on 28 September 1907, in Banga, Jaranwala Tehsil,
        Lyallpur district, Punjab, British India, into a family of Punjabi
        Sikhs. His father and two of his uncles were members of the ‘Ghadar
        Party.’ They were also actively involved in the Indian independence
        struggle. They were in jail at the time of Bhagat Singh’s birth due to
        their participation in revolutionary activities.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        Bhagat Singh received his primary education from ‘Dayanand Anglo-Vedic
        High School,’ an ‘Arya Samaji’ institution.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        Inspired by his father and uncles, he grew up to be a patriotic young
        man and decided to dedicate his life to the independence movement. He
        became disillusioned with Gandhi’s philosophy of non-violence and joined
        the ‘Young Revolutionary Movement.’ He then began to advocate violent
        overthrow of the British Government in India.

      <p class="content">
        The superintendent of police James A. Scott ordered a baton charge
        against the protesters and Rai was grievously injured. He died a few
        days later on 17 November 1928 of a heart attack. His injuries were
        believed to have hastened his untimely death.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        The shooting was scheduled to take place on 17 December 1928.
        Interestingly, a case of mistaken identity ensued and the
        revolutionaries killed John P. Saunders instead of Scott. Saunders, an
        assistant superintendent of police, was shot to death as he was leaving
        the District Police Headquarters in Lahore
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        The young revolutionaries had already planned an elaborate escape and
        were successful in evading arrest. A day after Saunders was killed, a
        leaflet was circulated by the ‘Hindustan Socialist Republican
        Association,’ announcing that the death of Lala Lajpat Rai had been
        avenged.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        Before long, Singh began planning his next protest to gain massive
        publicity for the cause of Indian independence. Along with other members
        of HSRA, he planned to explode a bomb inside the ‘Central Legislative
        Assembly’ to protest against the ‘Public Safety Bill’ and the ‘Trade
        Dispute Act’ which were being enacted by the Viceroy using his special
        powers, even though they had been rejected by the Assembly.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        On 8 April 1929, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, hurled two
        bombs into the Assembly chamber from its public gallery. Their intention
        was not to kill anyone but to gain publicity. After the explosion, the
        young men began shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long Live the
        Revolution") and threw leaflets. Then they allowed the authorities to
        arrest them.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        Singh was given life sentence for the bombing. Shortly after, he was
        also charged for the murder of Saunders along with Sukhdev, Rajguru, and
        21 others. Meanwhile, his life sentence in the Assembly Bomb case was
        deferred and he was moved to the ‘Central Jail Mianwali’ from the jail
        in Delhi.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        Singh’s growing popularity bothered the British authorities greatly and
        the government decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder
        trial, which was henceforth called the ‘Lahore Conspiracy Case.’
        Following the trial, Singh, Sukhdev, and Rajguru were sentenced to death
        by hanging.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        The three men were hanged on 23 March 1931 in Lahore jail. Bhagat Singh
        was just 23 years old. The bodies were then secretly cremated outside
        the Ganda Singh Wala village.

      <p class="content">
        Bhagat Singh is best-remembered for his role in the assassination of
        John Saunders, a British police officer. His original plan was to kill
        James A. Scott, the British officer who had ordered a baton charge on
        Lala Lajpat Rai during a peaceful protest. When Rai died a few days
        later, Singh decided to avenge his death by killing the British officer.

      <p class="content">
        Bhagat Singh’s parents tried to arrange marriage for him but he remained
        steadfast in his resolve to avoid getting married as he wanted to
        dedicate his entire life to India’s struggle for independence.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        He holds a significant position in the history of the Indian
        independence movement and his legend continues to inspire the youth of
        contemporary India. He has been the subject of numerous books, plays,
        and films.

        The ‘Shaheed-e-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh Museum’ was opened on his 50th
        death anniversary at his ancestral village, Khatkar Kalan.

        He was voted the ‘Greatest Indian,’ ahead of Subhas Chandra Bose and
        Gandhi, in a poll organized by ‘India Today’ in 2008.

      <p class="content">
        An 18-foot tall bronze statue of Bhagat Singh was installed in the
        Parliament of India, beside the statues of Indira Gandhi and Subhas
        Chandra Bose.
